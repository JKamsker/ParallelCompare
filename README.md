# FsEqual

FsEqual is a fast, Spectre.Console-powered comparison tool that inspects two directory trees (or a tree against a saved baseline) in parallel. The experience unifies a rich interactive TUI, automation-friendly CLI, snapshotting, and export pipelines so that changes are always clear‚Äîwhether you are shipping to production or reviewing a pull request.

## Highlights

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **High-throughput comparisons** powered by parallel workers and configurable hash algorithms.
- üß≠ **Interactive inspector** with filtering, theming, diff tooling, and live watch mode.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Baselines & snapshots** to freeze known-good trees and validate future changes.
- üì¶ **Portable exports** including JSON, CSV, Markdown, and baseline manifests for CI/CD.
- üîå **Extensible configuration** via profiles, ignore patterns, diff tool integration, and exporters.

## Install

```bash
# Install as a global .NET tool
dotnet tool install --global FsEqual.Tool

# Update to the latest release
dotnet tool update --global FsEqual.Tool
```

For isolated scenarios, publish a self-contained binary:

```bash
dotnet publish src/FsEqual.App -c Release -r <rid>
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Compare two directories with hashing and interactive mode enabled
fsequal compare ./src ./baseline --algo sha256 --interactive

# Monitor directories continuously and rerun on change
git checkout main
fsequal watch ./src ./baseline --debounce 500

# Capture a baseline manifest for regression testing
fsequal snapshot ./src --output artifacts/baseline.json

# Validate configuration without running the engine
fsequal compare ./src ./baseline --dry-run

# Produce exports silently for automation
fsequal compare ./src ./baseline --quiet --summary artifacts/summary.json
```
