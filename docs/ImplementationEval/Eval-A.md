# fsEqual Implementation Assessment and Plan

## Evaluation criteria

To pick the strongest pull request we compared each submission against the mandatory behaviours in `docs/spec.md`, focusing on:

- CLI coverage for the `compare` command options, configuration, and exit codes.
- Depth of the interactive TUI experience (tree navigation, filtering, exports, live re-run controls).
- Support for advanced modes called out in the spec (watch mode, snapshot/baseline support, shell completions, exporter coverage).
- Implementation quality items such as concurrency, correctness of ignore handling, and user-facing diagnostics.

## Pull request reviews

### PR #1 (`pr1`)
- **Strengths**: Implements the full `compare` verb with option parsing, JSON/summary export, basic profile loading, and a Spectre-based output pipeline. Hashing is parallelised and supports CRC32/MD5/SHA-256/XXH64. Ships a completion generator.
- **Gaps & issues**: Ignore handling uses Spectre's matcher with `AddInclude` instead of `AddExclude`, effectively turning ignore glob lists into allow-lists. The interactive view is a single table with a coarse filter cycle, lacking the tree drill-down, re-compare, and exporter ergonomics spelled out in the spec. No watch, snapshot, or baseline commands.

### PR #2 (`pr2`)
- **Strengths**: Adds dedicated `watch`, `snapshot`, and baseline comparison flows. Comparison logic tracks directory, file, and baseline differences separately, and the Spectre output honours verbosity. Hashing is parallelised and can stream progress. Interactive mode offers filtering, exporting, and per-entry inspection.
- **Gaps & issues**: The interactive experience is menu-driven and still table-only, so the spec's tree-based navigation, live pipeline controls, and key bindings are missing. Configuration hooks (`--profile`, `--config`) exist in the option model but no loader is wired up. JSON export serialises internal models directly with minimal shaping.

### PR #3 (`pr3`)
- **Strengths**: Delivers the richest interactive TUI: a collapsible tree with status glyphs, directory roll-ups, detail panes, filter cycling, export, re-run, and on-the-fly algorithm switching, closely mirroring the spec. Comparison results keep a tree of nodes plus difference records, enabling that experience.
- **Gaps & issues**: Only a `compare` command is wired; there is no watch mode, snapshot/baseline support, completion generation, or configuration/profile loading. Reports only cover console/JSON/markdown from the compare flow.

### PR #4 (`pr4`)
- **Strengths**: Combines the broader command surface (`compare`, `watch`, `snapshot`, `completion`) with configuration/profile loading, baseline comparisons, progress reporting, and export utilities. Hashing and enumeration respect ignore patterns and symlinks, and there is a progress-driven CLI UX.
- **Gaps & issues**: The interactive explorer is still list-based and lacks tree navigation, refresh, and algorithm toggling; exporter UX is serviceable but could reuse the richer ReportExporter API from other submissions. Some summary metrics (e.g., equal vs different split per directory) are flatter than the spec describes.

## Recommendation

PR #4 is the strongest foundation because it covers the command surface (watch, snapshot, completion) and configuration story expected by the spec while maintaining solid comparison semantics. However, PR #3's interactive workflow is the only submission that really satisfies the spec's TUI expectations. PR #2 supplies a nicer separation of comparison summaries (directories/files/baseline) and baseline-aware exports that could enhance reporting.

Therefore, the best path forward is a "best of all worlds" merge:

1. **Adopt PR #4 as the base** for its command coverage, configuration loader, and watch/snapshot implementations.
2. **Port PR #3's interactive session** (tree view, refresh, algorithm switching, exports) onto the PR #4 core models, adjusting the report/difference models as needed.
3. **Lift PR #2's richer reporting concepts**—particularly the distinct baseline difference tracking and JSON shaping—so exports reflect the spec's detailed breakdowns.
4. **Audit PR #1 for reusable utilities** (e.g., more structured JSON summary payloads) but avoid inheriting its ignore-pattern regression.
5. After merging the features, add missing polish from the spec: live pipeline controls (pause/resume), diff-tool launch hooks, shell completion distribution, and tests/automation.

This plan yields the most spec-compliant implementation without discarding the significant auxiliary work already delivered across the submissions.
