# fsEqual Consolidated Implementation Evaluation

## Approach
- Reviewed docs/spec.md to extract mandatory CLI, TUI, export, and advanced workflow requirements.
- Inspected all four candidate branches (codex/implement-plan-in-docs/spec.md, codex/implement-plan-in-docs/spec.md-ehgdxp, codex/implement-plan-in-docs/spec.md-fs5wxg, codex/implement-plan-in-docs/spec.md-jzl3qc) to compare command surface, configuration story, interactive experience, and extensibility.
- Cross-referenced findings from the prior evaluation documents (Eval-A through Eval-D) to capture unique strengths, regressions, and follow-up work.

## Spec Expectations Snapshot
- CLI: compare verb with comprehensive option set (threads, hash algorithm, ignore globs, profiles/config, JSON/summary exports, fail-on policy) and precise exit codes.
- Interactive mode: Spectre.Console tree/table exploration with live progress, filtering, per-node detail, algorithm toggling, re-queue, export shortcuts, verbosity cycling, pause/resume, and diff hooks.
- Advanced workflows: watch mode with debounce, snapshot/manifest creation and validation, baseline comparisons, shell completion generation, diff-tool integration, remote compare stubs, and exporter fan-out.
- Cross-cutting quality: parallel hashing (CRC32/MD5/SHA256/XXH64), robust ignore handling, structured logging, and an extensible exporter/configuration pipeline.

## Branch Findings
### codex/implement-plan-in-docs/spec.md (config-first CLI)
- **Strengths**: Merges CLI/config/profile inputs via ResolvedCompareSettings; solid option validation; parallel hashing with all required algorithms; structured console output and JSON/summary exports; ships completion generator.
- **Gaps**: Only compare/completion commands; interactive mode is single-screen list lacking tree navigation, re-run, or algorithm switching; no watch/snapshot/baseline/diff support.
- **Risks**: Ignore glob handling mistakenly wires patterns as includes, turning ignores into allow-lists and risking false negatives.

### codex/implement-plan-in-docs/spec.md-ehgdxp (TUI-centric branch)
- **Strengths**: Delivers full Spectre tree explorer with status glyphs, expand/collapse, filtering, re-compare, on-the-fly hash switching, export prompts, and verbosity cycling; comparison engine maintains hierarchical nodes suited for advanced UI features.
- **Gaps**: Lacks watch, snapshot, and configuration/profile loading; CLI validates inputs eagerly, making baseline runs difficult; export story outside the TUI is limited to basic JSON/markdown.
- **Risks**: No shared exporter/config pipeline, so integrating with a broader command surface requires refactoring.

### codex/implement-plan-in-docs/spec.md-fs5wxg (command-surface branch)
- **Strengths**: Implements compare, watch, snapshot, and completion commands; baseline handling and watch debounce included; configuration/profile loader hydrates defaults, ignore globs, and destinations; exports cover JSON, CSV, and markdown.
- **Gaps**: Interactive explorer is menu-driven without tree navigation, live refresh, or algorithm toggles; comparison model is flat, making it harder to graft a rich TUI; some pipeline stages mix enumeration, comparison, and reporting concerns.
- **Risks**: Error handling around config/baseline resolution is thin, so failure modes need hardening when merged into a richer UX.

### codex/implement-plan-in-docs/spec.md-jzl3qc (most complete baseline)
- **Strengths**: Provides compare/watch/snapshot/completion commands, baseline validation, cancellation handling, fail-on policies, progress reporting, and JSON/summary exports; comparison core separates file/directory/baseline diffs cleanly.
- **Gaps**: --config/--profile flags are parsed but unimplemented; interactive session remains list-based without tree navigation, re-run, or algorithm toggling; diff-tool/remote compare/parallel exporter fan-out still absent.
- **Risks**: Without a configuration loader, users must restate options per command; interactive UX falls short of spec expectations despite otherwise broad feature coverage.

## Consolidated Observations
- No single branch meets the full spec; spec.md-jzl3qc covers the widest command surface, while spec.md-ehgdxp is the only one that fulfills the interactive UX.
- Configuration/profile resolution from spec.md (and echoed in spec.md-fs5wxg) is necessary to make watch/snapshot workflows practical.
- Export infrastructure is fragmented: JSON/summary collectors sit in different branches, CSV/markdown live elsewhere, and none deliver the parallel fan-out expected by the spec.
- Quality gaps include the ignore matcher regression (spec.md), limited error handling around baselines (spec.md-fs5wxg), and the absence of diff-tool and remote compare hooks across all branches.

## Recommended Integration Strategy
1. **Adopt spec.md-jzl3qc as the structural base** to inherit the full command set, baseline/watch implementations, and mature comparison/reporting core.
2. **Port the configuration/profile pipeline** from spec.md (and reconcile with spec.md-fs5wxg) so all commands honor layered defaults, profiles, and CLI overrides; fix the ignore matcher regression during the merge.
3. **Replace the interactive session** with the tree-driven explorer from spec.md-ehgdxp, adapting its ComparisonNode model to the base branch’s comparer and wiring keyboard shortcuts for filter, re-run, algorithm toggle, export, verbosity, pause/resume, and diff launch.
4. **Unify exporters** by combining the JSON/summary writers from spec.md/spec.md-jzl3qc with the CSV/markdown fan-out in spec.md-fs5wxg, then extend to true parallel export so CLI flags and interactive E actions share one pipeline.
5. **Harden watch and snapshot flows** with the debounce ergonomics from spec.md-fs5wxg, ensuring they reuse the merged configuration, exporter, and TUI layers (including the ability to re-use snapshots inside the interactive UI).
6. **Add diff-tool and remote compare hooks** using the base branch’s metadata, providing graceful degradation (TODO stubs or informative errors) until full implementations land.
7. **Strengthen validation and diagnostics**: align exit codes, improve baseline/config error reporting, add structured logging, and cover the merged paths with unit/integration tests.

## Outstanding Spec Work After Integration
- Remote compare execution (SSH streaming) remains future work beyond stubs.
- Parallel exporter fan-out to additional formats (HTML, SQLite, custom plugins) is still unimplemented.
- Theming, telemetry, and ecosystem tooling (VS Code extension, GitHub Action, Azure DevOps task) require separate planning once the core consolidates.

## Validation Checklist for the Final Merge
- All commands (compare, watch, snapshot, completion) respect merged configuration defaults, ignore globs, and profile overrides.
- Interactive mode offers tree navigation, filtering, re-compare, algorithm switching, export shortcuts, verbosity cycling, pause/resume, and diff launch, matching the spec’s key bindings.
- CLI exports and interactive exports share the same multi-format pipeline without race conditions.
- Ignore handling, hashing, and baseline comparisons produce correct results across platforms, with tests covering regression cases (including the prior ignore bug).
